## QUESTIONS
1. **What Linear Regression training algorithm can you use if you have a training set with millions of features?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

2. **Suppose the features in your training set have very different scales. What algorithms might suffer from this, and how? What can you do about it?**
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

3. **Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic Regression model?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

4. **Do all Gradient Descent algorithms lead to the same model provided you let them run long enough?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

5. **Suppose you use Batch Gradient Descent and you plot the validation error at every epoch. If you notice that the validation error consistently goes up, what is likely going on? How can you fix this?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

6. **Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the validation error goes up?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

7. **Which Gradient Descent algorithm (among those we discussed) will reach the vicinity of the optimal solution the fastest? Which will actually converge? How can you make the others converge as well?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

8. **Suppose you are using Polynomial Regression. You plot the learning curves and you notice that there is a large gap between the training error and the validation error. What is happening? What are three ways to solve this?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

9. **Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. Would you say that the model suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regularization hyperparameter Î± or reduce it?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

10. **Why would you want to use:**  
- **Ridge Regression instead of plain Linear Regression (i.e., without any regularization)?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*
- **Lasso instead of Ridge Regression?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

- **Elastic Net instead of Lasso?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

11. **Suppose you want to classify pictures as outdoor/indoor and daytime/nighttime.  Should you implement two Logistic Regression classifiers or one Softmax Regression classifier?**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*

12. **Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression (without using Scikit-Learn).**  
*TYPE ANSWER HERE*
